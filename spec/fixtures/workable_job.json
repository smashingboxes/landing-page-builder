Within our walls you are your client, meaning: you represent their vision and best interests to our teams and all of SB. However, this doesn\u2019t mean you do whatever clients ask of you. You have the responsibility of asking them the hard questions that challenge their thinking. And you aren\u2019t afraid to tell them when something they want might be a bad idea for their product. However, you do this with good reason, grace and by offering alternative solutions because you never leave them feeling like you don\u2019t have their back.</p><p>You are also accountable to your teams. Partnering with project managers, your new best friend at SB, you are responsible for ensuring teams get what they need from clients in a timely manner to deliver the best work possible. And just as you have the client\u2019s back, you also have your team\u2019s back. You walk a fine line between the two, but this isn\u2019t your first rodeo \u2013 you manage this split-personality requirement with ease.</p><p>On a daily basis, you are constantly on the lookout for ways to provide new value to your accounts. So much value that our clients should eventually feel they can't manage without you as a part of your team. At the end of each engagement, clients often come back to work with us again not just because we deliver amazing products, but because they want you to still be thinking about their business more so than their own team members.
